Brazil plays a significant, though secondary, role, with its share showing an upward trend in certain recent financial years.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(table2, aes(x = Fin_Year, y = Import, fill = Country)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"stack\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x = Fin_Year, y = Import,\n                  label = ifelse(Share&lt;5, \"\", paste0(Share, \"%\"))),\n              position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 5, color = \"black\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set2\")+\n    my_theme +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n    labs(y = \"Quantity (Tonns)\") +\n    ggtitle(\"Soybean Oil Import\")-&gt;p2\np2"
