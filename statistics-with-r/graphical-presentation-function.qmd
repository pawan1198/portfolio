In the beginning of the session, we first start with the problems on cardinality
of functions, then we illustrate the method of plotting a graph of a given step
function. Thereafter, we shall illustrate the method of creating line plots,
graphs of convex functions, concave functions and planes, with the help of
some suitable problems. Lastly, we illustrate the methods of creating graphs of
gamma and beta functions.
Different functions such as 'plot()', 'abline()', 'curve()', 'text()', 'outer()', 'persp()' and many others are discussed in this session to create different plots/graphs.
